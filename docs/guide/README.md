# Getting Started

The latest modV version can be found on our GitHub. We're currently working towards 2.0 status, with automatic release builds coming soon.

Until we have automatic release builds, you can clone the project and use `npm i` to install the dependencies, then `npm build` to build the application which can then be found in `nwjs/build/`.

## System Requirements
### Minimum
* Mac, Windows or Linux (with desktop shell)
* Node.jsÂ® (v9.0.0+)

### Recommended
* NVIDIA or ATI graphics card
